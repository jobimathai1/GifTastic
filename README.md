# GifTastic
A giphy search, allows users to search &amp; add their favorite gif on to the page. Using the Giphy API, user enters a search term (i.e. "dogs", "cats") and performs a search. Once the search is complete, a button is added to the page with the search term entered by the user. 

If the user were to click on the search term, then a search is performed on Giphy using their API and 10 Gifs are loaded on to the page. The gifs default behavior is set to be the still image. Once the user clicks on the Gif, then it will animate.
